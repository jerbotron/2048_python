# 2048 Python App
This is a re-make of the popular 2028 block puzzle game originally seen here: https://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/.

I re-made the game using Python and pygame libraries. There is a pseudo auto-solver implementation that hasn't been perfected yet. 

To run the game, make sure you have Python2.7+ and pygame installed and type "python maingame.py" to start the game.
